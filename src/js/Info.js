            <p>
            - added sprite number tooltips for sprites in the sprite list<br/>
            - the menu palette can now be moved around and the position is saved<br/>
            - updated to jquery 3.3.1, code cleanup (removed playfield code)<br/>
            - the tools in the sprite list window are now fixed to the top<br/>
            - some tweaks to the window design<br/>

            </p>

            <h1>V1.06</h1>
            <p>
            - added divider lines in the editor grid view (thx2 v3to)<br/>
            - zoom icons moved from right side of the window to the left for better usability<br/>

            <br/>
            
            <p>
            Although not many features had been added, it took me quite a while to finish this release. I had to revert a lot of code for a really cool new feature that I didn't get to work reliably. Because of that, I had to maintain two code branches and backport features into the stable version. I finally decided to put the new feature on hold and focus on others instead.
            </p>

            <h1>V1.05</h1>
            <p>
            - Added a brief documentation (click on help in the menu bar).<br/>
            - Fixed an error in Kick Assembler export (thx2 nurpax)
            </p>

            <br/>
            
            <p>I didn't get any chance to work on Spritemate for months due to my commercial stuff sucking away all my free time. Also, feedback was stopping recently, which didn't motivate me too much either. Eventually I checked the traffic for Spritemate and was suprised about the steady amount of users. So I decided to dedicate more time to this project again. In any case, if you like Spritemate, you can make a hell of a difference by letting me know, either by mail ( ingo at awsm dot de ) or by sending me a tweet ( <a href="https://twitter.com/awsm9000">@awsm9000</a> ). Let me know how I can make Spritemate better for you!</p>

            <h2>Save settings & color palette change</h2>
            <p>
            Spritemate saves settings locally now. 
            It might work a bit wonky still and I know about at least one case where the code works but should not as to my understanding (but who am I to judge the developer...). 
            Anyway, the foundation for more configuration options has been layed for future updates.

            <h2>First public beta release</h2>
            <p>
            spritemate is now in public beta. Thanks to all the beta testers who helped find bugs and suggest features and improvements. Please check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Esshahn/spritemate">documentation on Github</a> to get a feature overview.

            <h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
            <p>
            The most common actions have received hotkeys for quick access. 
            Using hotkeys in a browser is always a bit tricky, as many combinations are taken by the browser (like CMD/CTRL + C for "copy"). 
            Therefore some shortcuts might seem less intuitive. These functions are available by pressing keys now:
            </p>
            
            <br/>

            <p>
            (1,2,3,4) - set one of the four available pens/colors<br/>
            (f) - toggle fullscreen on/off<br/>
            (d) - toggle between "draw" and "fill" modes<br/>
            (z) - undo, (shift + z) = redo<br/>
            (m) - toggle singlecolor/multicolor<br/>
            (cursor left, right) - navigate through sprite list (thx2 Wiebo)<br/>
            </p>
